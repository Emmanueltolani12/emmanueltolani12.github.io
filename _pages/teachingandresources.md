## Applied microeconometrics in R

I teach an advanced masters/Ph.D. class on applied microeconometrics in R. The resources are available on my Github page, [**here**](https://github.com/JoshMerfeld/applied-microeconometrics).

- The raw markdown files for the slides contain plenty of useful comments and examples.
- Please feel free to make use of any of the code. Or, if you have questions, feel free to e-mail me!


## Working with others

I put together some slides for our Ph.D. students focused on setting up projects when working with others. These slides focus on two things:

1. Using Dropbox to keep all files up to date
2. Using relative paths so that files run on everyone's computer

You can view the slides [**here**](https://joshmerfeld.github.io/sharedworkspaces/#1).


## Geospatial data and small area estimation

Stay tuned for a primer aimed at discussing the ins and outs of integrating geospatial data and survey data for small area estimation in R, with a particular emphasis on improving estimates of SDGs.

- This work is with UN Stats and is aimed at practitioners and national statistics offices, but it will also contain a short guide on using geospatial data. 
- In the meantime, please check out UN Stats' SAE4SDG page, [here](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/SAE4SDG/).
- As part of this work, I taught a workshop in Nairobi, in combination with UN Stats, UN ECA, and UN EAC, on integrating geospatial data into small area estimation. You can find my slides [here](https://github.com/JoshMerfeld/nairobiworkshops).
