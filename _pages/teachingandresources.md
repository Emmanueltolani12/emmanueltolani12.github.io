# Class materials

I teach two classes here at the KDI School for which I have made my materials publicly available. In both cases:

- The raw quarto/markdown files for the slides contain plenty of useful comments and examples.
- All of the data I use as examples in class are uploaded to the repository so you can follow along and do the examples yourself.
- Please feel free to make use of any of the code. Or, if you have questions, feel free to e-mail me!

## Applied microeconometrics in R

I teach an advanced masters/Ph.D. class on applied microeconometrics in R. The resources are available on my Github page, [**here**](https://github.com/JoshMerfeld/applied-microeconometrics).

- Note that I am transitioning to Quarto and HTML slides, but the older markdown files are available in the [weeks folder](https://github.com/JoshMerfeld/applied-microeconometrics/tree/main/weeks).


## Geospatial data analysis in R

I am teaching a new masters class on geospatial data analysis in R. The resources are available on my Github page, [**here**](https://github.com/JoshMerfeld/geospatialdataR).

- This is a new class in Fall 2024 so the website is not complete yet. 
- All slides are HTML and made using Quarto (in R).


# Working with others

I put together some slides for our Ph.D. students focused on setting up projects when working with others. These slides focus on two things:

1. Using Dropbox to keep all files up to date
2. Using relative paths so that files run on everyone's computer

You can view the slides [**here**](https://joshmerfeld.github.io/sharedworkspaces/#1).


# Geospatial data and small area estimation

Stay tuned for a primer aimed at discussing the ins and outs of integrating geospatial data and survey data for small area estimation in R, with a particular emphasis on improving estimates of SDGs.

- This work is with UN Stats and is aimed at practitioners and national statistics offices, but it will also contain a short guide on using geospatial data. 
- In the meantime, please check out UN Stats' SAE4SDG page, [here](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/SAE4SDG/).
- As part of this work, I taught a workshop in Nairobi, in combination with UN Stats, UN ECA, and UN EAC, on integrating geospatial data into small area estimation. You can find my slides [here](https://github.com/JoshMerfeld/nairobiworkshops). I will upload all of the slides from the Bangkok workshop in late October 2024. These will draw heavily from my geospatial analysis class, however, which you can find above.
- There are also two upcoming R packages that will make this easier. Please check back for updates!
