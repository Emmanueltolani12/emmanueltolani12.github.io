I am an assistant professor at the KDI School of Public Policy and Management in Sejong City, South Korea.

My research and teaching interests include the microeconomics of development, applied microeconometrics, labor markets in developing countries, and poverty. Some of my previous and ongoing research looks at labor productivity and wages, agriculture, structural transformation, poverty, and public works programs. I am particularly interested in how market failures affect household and individual resource allocation decisions and in how we can improve the measurement of poverty.

I received my Ph.D. from the University of Washington (UW). I also have a M.S. from UW, a M.P.P. from Georgia State University, and a B.A. from the University of Georgia.
