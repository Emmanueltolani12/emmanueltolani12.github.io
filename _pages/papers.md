Reliable estimates of economic welfare for small areas are valuable inputs into the design and evaluation of development policies. This paper compares the accuracy of point estimates and confidence intervals for small area estimates of wealth and poverty derived from four different prediction methods: linear mixed models, Cubist regression, extreme gradient boosting, and boosted regression forests. The evaluation draws samples from unit-level household census data from four separate developing countries, combines them with publicly and globally available geospatial indicators to generate small area estimates, and evaluates these estimates against aggregates calculated using the full census. Predictions of wealth are evaluated in four countries and poverty in one. All three machine learning methods outperform the traditional linear mixed model, with extreme gradient boosting and boosted regression forests generally outperforming the other alternatives. The proposed residual bootstrap procedure reliably estimates confidence intervals for the machine learning estimators, with estimated coverage rates across simulations falling between 94 and 97 percent. These results demonstrate that predictions obtained using tree-based gradient boosting with a random effect block bootstrap generate more accurate point and uncertainty estimates than prevailing methods for generating small area welfare estimates.

This article examines the extent to which combining survey data with publicly available geospatial indicators improves estimates of state and municipal labor force statistics in urban Mexico. Model-based estimates of labor force participation and unemployment are generated separately for men and women, using a population-weighted nested-error conditional random effect model following an arcsin transformation, specified at the level of the Área Geoestadística Básica (AGEB). Two types of hypothetical samples are used to estimate the model: a simple random sample of individuals within AGEBs selected using proportional to size sampling, and a full enumeration of all households within those same AGEBs. The resulting small area estimates are compared against results from the full census. Incorporating geospatial data improves the precision and accuracy of state-level estimates for all four indicators, despite the weak predictive power of the unemployment rate model. At the municipality level, small area estimates substantially improve on survey estimates of labor force participation. For unemployment rates, the results when using the simple random sample are mixed because of the large number of municipalities with no unemployed persons in the sample. Using the full enumeration sample greatly improves municipal predictions for all four indicators. These results are robust to the use of repeated simulations of alternative samples. Integrating survey data and publicly available geospatial indicators significantly improves the accuracy and precision of both state-level estimates and estimated municipal labor force participation rates at negligible cost, but accurately estimating low-probability events like unemployment with a linear model requires large samples within target areas.

**Small Area Estimation of Monetary Poverty in Mexico using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning** (with David Newhouse, Anusha Pudugramam Ramakrishnan, Tom Swartz, and Partha Lahiri). Revision requested, _Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics_.<br/>

Estimates of poverty are an important input into policy formulation in developing countries. The accurate measurement of poverty rates is therefore a first-order problem for development policy. This paper shows that combining satellite imagery with household surveys can improve the precision and accuracy of estimated poverty rates in Mexican municipalities, a level at which the survey is not considered representative. It also shows that a household-level model outperforms other common small area estimation methods. However, poverty estimates in 2015 derived from geospatial data remain less accurate than 2010 estimates derived from household census data. These results indicate that the incorporation of household survey data and widely available satellite imagery can improve on existing poverty estimates in developing countries when census data are old or when patterns of poverty are changing rapidly, even for small subgroups.

**Air pollution and agricultural productivity in a developing country**. _Under review_.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('coal')">Abstract</a> | [Draft](/assets/papers/pollution2023.pdf) | [Most recent slides](/pollution-slides/#1) ] </small>

<div id="coal" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2">
<small>
I document negative externalities of air pollution in the Indian agricultural sector. Using variation in pollution induced by changes in wind across years, I show that higher levels of pollution lead to decreased agricultural productivity, with large changes in productivity being common. The negative effects of pollution are larger in areas growing more labor-intensive crops, indicating that the pollution works at least partly through direct effects on labor productivity. Finally, combining wind direction with the rollout of coal plants, results indicate that pollution from coal plants has a larger effect on agricultural productivity than other types of pollution. Given that the agricultural sector is a refuge for the poor in many developing countries, these results suggest that the negative externalities of pollution may hit the poorest particularly hard.

**Minimum wages and unemployment during economic shocks** (with Matthew Sharp). _Under review_.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('agWages')">Abstract</a> | [Draft](/assets/papers/MerfeldSharp2023.pdf) ] </small>


<div id="agWages" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2">
<small>
The imposition of a minimum wage can affect how labour markets respond to economic shocks. Using data from South Africa, we show that an agricultural minimum wage leads to higher average wages without any impact on employment. However, the seemingly positive results with respect to the overall mean hide important heterogeneity: the imposition of the minimum wage leads to relatively large decreases in overall employment and income in the sector in the wake of negative agricultural productivity shocks, when there is usually downward pressure on wages. This heterogeneity essentially increases the variance of employment across years, suggesting caution in interpreting mean effects of minimum wage increases.

One of the sharpest and most common simplifications when measuring poverty has been to define poverty as a deficiency in yearly income or yearly consumption. The measures approximate the experience of poverty for those households whose income is steady or who can smooth consumption through the year. In reality, however, the experience of poverty is often marked by seasonality, economic instability, and illiquidity across months. To capture these elements, we introduce a measurement framework based on a straightforward generalization of conventional poverty measures, defining annual poverty as the average of monthly poverty measures. Using monthly panel data from India, we explore ways that the conventional approach to measurement can underestimate and mischaracterize the experience of poverty when households face the dual challenges of low incomes and instability. We show that experiences of poverty are substantially more common than annual measures suggest. Entry into and exit from poverty are much less clear than typically assumed, and the proposed measure is a stronger predictor of development outcomes -- weight and height -- than conventional measures. Correspondingly, the framework shows how interventions that re-distribute resources between periods can lessen the experience of poverty by improving consumption smoothing, even when conventional poverty measures based on yearly resources are unchanged or worsening. In considering hypothetical monthly transfers to households facing economic instability, for example, we show that targeting transfers to the most challenging months -- rather than spreading them through the year as in typical cash transfer programs -- can most cost-effectively reduce experiences of poverty.
