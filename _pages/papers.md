This article examines the extent to which combining survey data with publicly available geospatial indicators improves estimates of state and municipal labor force statistics in urban Mexico. Model-based estimates of labor force participation and unemployment are generated separately for men and women, using a population-weighted nested-error conditional random effect model following an arcsin transformation, specified at the level of the Área Geoestadística Básica (AGEB). Two types of hypothetical samples are used to estimate the model: a simple random sample of individuals within AGEBs selected using proportional to size sampling, and a full enumeration of all households within those same AGEBs. The resulting small area estimates are compared against results from the full census. Incorporating geospatial data improves the precision and accuracy of state-level estimates for all four indicators, despite the weak predictive power of the unemployment rate model. At the municipality level, small area estimates substantially improve on survey estimates of labor force participation. For unemployment rates, the results when using the simple random sample are mixed because of the large number of municipalities with no unemployed persons in the sample. Using the full enumeration sample greatly improves municipal predictions for all four indicators. These results are robust to the use of repeated simulations of alternative samples. Integrating survey data and publicly available geospatial indicators significantly improves the accuracy and precision of both state-level estimates and estimated municipal labor force participation rates at negligible cost, but accurately estimating low-probability events like unemployment with a linear model requires large samples within target areas.

This paper presents evidence of misallocation across households in rural Indian agriculture. I show that household demographics predict own farm labor demand for smallholder farmers but not non-smallholder farmers. A simple model of labor allocation predicts a clear consequence of this duality: smallholder farmers will reallocate labor across plots less in response to price changes than non-smallholders. Detailed household panel data confirms this theoretical prediction. Three additional facts suggest that a lack of off-farm labor opportunities may be partly responsible for the behavior of smallholders, leading smallholders to overallocate labor to agricultural production. First, smallholders report fewer hours of involuntary unemployment when own crop prices increase. Second, yield is substantially higher for smallholders on plots of the same size. Finally, estimated marginal revenue products of labor are consistently lower for smallholders.

<small>
One of the sharpest and most common simplifications when measuring poverty has been to define poverty as a deficiency in yearly income or yearly consumption. The measures approximate the experience of poverty for those households whose income is steady or who can smooth consumption through the year. In reality, however, the experience of poverty is often marked by seasonality, economic instability, and illiquidity across months. To capture these elements, we introduce a measurement framework based on a straightforward generalization of conventional poverty measures, defining annual poverty as the average of monthly poverty measures. Using monthly panel data from India, we explore ways that the conventional approach to measurement can underestimate and mischaracterize the experience of poverty when households face the dual challenges of low incomes and instability. We show that experiences of poverty are substantially more common than annual measures suggest. Entry into and exit from poverty are much less clear than typically assumed, and the proposed measure is a stronger predictor of development outcomes -- weight and height -- than conventional measures. Correspondingly, the framework shows how interventions that re-distribute resources between periods can lessen the experience of poverty by improving consumption smoothing, even when conventional poverty measures based on yearly resources are unchanged or worsening. In considering hypothetical monthly transfers to households facing economic instability, for example, we show that targeting transfers to the most challenging months -- rather than spreading them through the year as in typical cash transfer programs -- can most cost-effectively reduce experiences of poverty.

**Small Area Estimation of Monetary Poverty in Mexico using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning** (with David Newhouse, Anusha Pudugramam Ramakrishnan, Tom Swartz, and Partha Lahiri). _Under review_.<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('satellite')">Abstract</a> | [Draft](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099430309142231728/idu0660868530404c0414e0bf180797b525682a5) ] </small>

Estimates of poverty are an important input into policy formulation in developing countries. The accurate measurement of poverty rates is therefore a first-order problem for development policy. This paper shows that combining satellite imagery with household surveys can improve the precision and accuracy of estimated poverty rates in Mexican municipalities, a level at which the survey is not considered representative. It also shows that a household-level model outperforms other common small area estimation methods. However, poverty estimates in 2015 derived from geospatial data remain less accurate than 2010 estimates derived from household census data. These results indicate that the incorporation of household survey data and widely available satellite imagery can improve on existing poverty estimates in developing countries when census data are old or when patterns of poverty are changing rapidly, even for small subgroups.

**Minimum wages and productivity shocks: Evidence from South Africa** (with Matthew Sharp).<br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('agWages')">Abstract</a> | Draft available upon request ] </small>


<div id="agWages" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2">
<small>
In developing countries, where wages can move seasonally following agricultural productivity, the imposition of a wage floor -- in the form of a minimum wage -- can affect how the labour market responds to productivity shocks. Using data from South Africa, we show that an agricultural minimum wage leads to higher average wages without any impact on employment. However, this seemingly positive results with respect to the overall mean hide important heterogeneity across different states of the world: the imposition of the minimum wage leads to decreases in overall employment and income in the sector during times of low agricultural productivity, when there is usually downward pressure on wages. The fact this happens during periods of low agricultural productivity is especially important for determining the overall welfare effects of the new minimum wage.
